# Getting Started:

For the purpose of this exercise, you will be using the Iris dataset, which is a famous and commonly used dataset in the field of data science. This dataset contains measurements of different species of iris flowers. 

The iris dataset is readily available in R and can be loaded for exploration and analysis. Here's how you can get started with the iris dataset in R:

## Import Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
iris
```

Take your time to look at the data!

The iris dataset consists of the following variables:

-   Sepal Length: The length of the iris flower's sepal (in cm).
-   Sepal Width: The width of the iris flower's sepal.
-   Petal Length: The length of the iris flower's petal.
-   Petal Width: The width of the iris flower's petal.
-   Species: The species of the iris flower, which can be one of three types: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

# Exercise 1: Bar Chart of Species Counts

**Your Task:**

You have a dataset named iris that contains information about different species of iris flowers. Create a bar chart to visualize the count of each `Species`. 

-   Give your visualization an appropriate title.
-   Try to make each bar have different color.
-   Make sure to give axes correct labels.

```{r}
# Create a bar chart of species counts

```


Your graph should look something like this:
![](count_of_iris_species.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 2: Box Plot of Sepal Length by Species

**Your Task:**

This time, create a box plot to compare the distribution of sepal length (`Sepal.Length`) for each species.

-   Give your visualization an appropriate title.
-   Try to make each box have different color.
-   Make sure to give axes correct labels.

```{r}
# Create a box plot of sepal length by species

```


Your graph should look something like this:
![](distribution_of_sepal_length_by_species.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 3: Scatterplot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width

Let's create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between sepal length (`Sepal.Length`) and sepal width (`Sepal.Width`). 

-   Give your visualization an appropriate title.
-   Color the points by species to distinguish them.
-   Make sure to give axes correct labels.

```{r}
# Create a scatterplot of sepal length vs. sepal width

```

Your graph should look something like this:
![](sepal_length_vs_sepal_width.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise 4: Petal Length Distribution Across Different Species

Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of petal lengths for each species in the iris dataset. 
Try to do this with one code snippet instead of 3 separate snippets for each species.

-   Give your visualization an appropriate title.
-   Color by species to distinguish them.
-   Make sure to give axes correct labels.
-   Adjust the `binwidth` parameter to make your graph both informative and neat.

```{r}
# Create a histogram of petal lengths for each species

```

Your graph should look something like this:
![](petal_length_dist.png)
